  intro: >
    Below are a few selected examples of projects I have worked on in the past few years. 
    These projects showcase my expertise, leadership, and the impact of my work in delivering

  assignments:
    - title: Event-Driven CoE @ Portuguese Retail Bank (2020 - 2021)
      tagline: |
        Led KPMG's 6-person team in partnership with the bank's architects to implement a full 
        event-driven Center of Excellence, enabling the adoption of Kafka-based architectures 
        on a private OpenShift cloud. Delivered 5 use cases to production in under a year, 
        processing over 1 million events per second. Leveraged technologies such as Kafka, 
        Spring Boot, IBM CDC, and MongoDB to implement patterns like core banking offload and 
        event-driven enablement for legacy applications. Overcame challenges in accessing core 
        banking data (MIPS) by using CDC, significantly reducing mainframe resource consumption.

    - title: Sapphirus @ KPMG Portugal (2020 - Present)
      tagline: |
        Designed and led the development of a cloud-ready, event-driven platform for compliance-based

        data models and rules, automated decision-making, document curation and extraction, and 
        integration with third-party data sources. Built on top of Kafka using open source technologies.
        Currently lead a 30-person team to continue develop the product and deliver projects.
        The solution can reduce end-to-end process times by up to 75% with great cost reduction.

        solution manages complex customer remediation workflows and generates highly 
        customized customer communications under strict regulatory requirements and tight timelines. 
        The approach enabled rapid time-to-market and adaptability to the client's global operations, 
        contributing to the project's ongoing success.
